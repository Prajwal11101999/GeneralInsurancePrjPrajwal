            <h3>There are two types of Car Insurance available:</h3>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><h4>1. Third-Party Liability Only Cover: </h4></p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Under this type of car insurance coverage, you will get the following benefits:
            -- Cost of repairs/replacement of the damaged vehicle of third parties
            -- Cost of hospitalization and treatment of third parties
            -- Liabilities arising out of death of third parties
            According to the Motor Vehicles Act, third-party car insurance coverage is a must to drive on the roads. The sum assured should be according to the driving conditions and sufficiently high to avoid out-of-pocket payments from your side.

        <p><h4>2. Comprehensive Car Insurance: </h4></p>
        <br />
        <p>
            This type of coverage gives the highest level of protection as it includes liability for third parties, damage to own vehicle, personal accident cover, and all non-collision damage such as storms, floods, fire and theft. You can further enhance a comprehensive car insurance policy with a choice of add-ons.
